# PhishNet ML Model Review & Improvement Plan

## Current ML Pipeline Overview
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Extracts 22 static features from URLs (lengths, special chars, TLDs, subdomains, suspicious patterns, etc.)
  - No network requests (fast, safe, but limited to URL structure)
- **Model Training:**
  - Uses a labeled dataset (`PhiUSIIL_Phishing_URL_Dataset.csv`)
  - Trains both Logistic Regression and Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
  - Scales features (StandardScaler)
  - Selects best model by ROC-AUC (currently Random Forest)
  - Saves model, scaler, feature importances, and metadata
- **Performance:**
  - Achieves very high ROC-AUC (0.99+) on test set
  - Feature importance is analyzed and saved

## Strengths
- Fast, safe, and interpretable (no external requests)
- Good coverage of common phishing tricks (length, TLD, special chars, etc.)
- Uses class balancing and hyperparameter tuning

## Limitations
- **No content or behavioral analysis:** Only URL structure is used (no page content, JS, redirects, etc.)
- **Cannot detect new/novel phishing tricks not in training data**
- **Dataset bias:** If the dataset is outdated or unbalanced, model may miss new threats
- **No real-time threat intelligence integration**

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Expand Feature Set:**
   - Add content-based features (e.g., page title, form count, external JS, favicon, etc.)
   - Use WHOIS/domain age, SSL cert info, and DNS features
   - Check for known phishing keywords in page content
2. **Use Ensemble/Stacked Models:**
   - Combine multiple models (e.g., Random Forest + XGBoost + Neural Net)
   - Use voting or stacking for better generalization
3. **Continuous Retraining:**
   - Regularly update the dataset with new phishing and legitimate URLs
   - Automate retraining and evaluation
4. **Hybrid Approach:**
   - Combine ML with rule-based and threat intelligence feeds (e.g., Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank)
   - Use blacklists/whitelists for known threats
5. **Explainability:**
   - Show users which features contributed most to a decision
   - Log and review false positives/negatives for further tuning
6. **User Feedback Loop:**
   - Allow users to report false positives/negatives to improve the model

## Realistic Expectation
- **100% accuracy is not possible** due to the evolving nature of phishing attacks, but these steps will maximize coverage and minimize errors.

## Next Steps
- Review and expand the dataset
- Add new features and retrain the model
- Integrate threat intelligence APIs
- Monitor and log model performance in production

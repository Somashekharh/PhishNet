# PhishNet Report Storage Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unwanted Files in Project
- **Problem**: Multiple temporary files, test scripts, and documentation files were cluttering the project
- **Files Removed**:
  - `quick_fix.py`
  - `quick_model_fix.py`
  - `test_model_fix.py`
  - `create_sample_data.py`
  - `ANIMATION_AND_ICON_FIXES.md`
  - `ERROR_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
  - `REPORT_AND_SCREENSHOT_FIXES.md`
  - `REPORT_GENERATION_SETUP.md`
  - `PHISHNET_SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md`
  - `PhishNet_Project_Synopsis.md`

### 2. Report Storage Issue
- **Problem**: Reports were not being stored or displayed properly in the frontend
- **Root Cause**: Cached results were not including `report_path` in the context

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Project Cleanup
- ✅ Removed all unwanted temporary files and scripts
- ✅ Kept essential maintenance scripts in `maintenance_scripts/` directory
- ✅ Maintained core project structure

### 2. Fixed Report Storage for Cached Results

#### File: `core/views.py`

**Problem**: When using cached results, the `report_path` was missing from the context, causing the "Generate Report" button to appear instead of download buttons.

**Before**:
```python
if cached_result and not force_rescan:
    print("Using cached result")
    cached_result['from_cache'] = True
    context = cached_result  # Missing report_path
```

**After**:
```python
if cached_result and not force_rescan:
    print("Using cached result")
    cached_result['from_cache'] = True
    
    # For cached results, we still need to perform URL analysis to get fresh report
    try:
        print("Performing URL analysis for cached result...")
        url_analysis, report_path = url_analyzer.analyze_url(url)
        # ... process analysis results
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"URL analysis error for cached result: {str(e)}")
        url_analysis = None
        report_path = None
    
    # Update cached result with fresh analysis and report
    context = {
        'url': url,
        'is_phishing': cached_result['is_phishing'],
        'confidence': cached_result['confidence'],
        'analysis': url_analysis,
        'report_path': report_path,  # Now included
        'from_cache': True
    }
```

**Key Improvements**:
- URL analysis is now performed for cached results to generate fresh reports
- `report_path` is properly included in the context for cached results
- Screenshots are captured for cached results
- Proper error handling for URL analysis failures

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging

Added comprehensive debug logging to track report generation:

```python
# URL analysis logging
print("Starting URL analysis...")
url_analysis, report_path = url_analyzer.analyze_url(url)
print(f"URL analysis completed: {url_analysis}")
print(f"Report path returned: {report_path}")

# Context creation logging
print(f"Context created - report_path: {report_path}")
print(f"Context keys: {list(context.keys())}")
```

## Testing Results

### Report Generation Test
```
=== Debug Report Generation ===
WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH: C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe
MEDIA_ROOT: C:\Users\SOMASHEKHAR HIREMATH\OneDrive\Desktop\Update_D\PhishNet\media
Reports directory exists: True

=== Testing PDF Report Generation ===
PDF report path: reports\report_https_example.com.pdf
Full path: C:\Users\SOMASHEKHAR HIREMATH\OneDrive\Desktop\Update_D\PhishNet\media\reports\report_https_example.com.pdf
File exists: True
File size: 32470 bytes
```

### URL Analyzer Test
```
=== Testing URL Analyzer ===
Analysis completed successfully
Result keys: ['domain_info', 'security_info', 'content_info', 'screenshot_path', 'redirect_chain', 'ssl_info', 'headers']
Report path: reports\report_https_example.com.pdf
✅ Report file exists: C:\Users\SOMASHEKHAR HIREMATH\OneDrive\Desktop\Update_D\PhishNet\media\reports\report_https_example.com.pdf
File size: 32470 bytes
✅ All required keys present in result
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Clean Project Structure
- **Before**: Cluttered with temporary files and scripts
- **After**: Clean, organized project structure

### 2. Consistent Report Generation
- **Before**: Reports only generated for fresh scans
- **After**: Reports generated for both cached and fresh scans

### 3. Better User Experience
- **Before**: "Generate Report" button appeared for cached results
- **After**: Download buttons appear for all scan results

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- **Before**: No visibility into report generation process
- **After**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## How to Test

### 1. Test Report Generation
1. Go to the scan form
2. Enter a URL (e.g., "https://example.com")
3. Click "Scan URL"
4. **Expected**: Download button should appear in results

### 2. Test Cached Results
1. Scan a URL for the first time
2. Scan the same URL again
3. **Expected**: Download button should still appear for cached results

### 3. Test Report Download
1. Click the download button
2. **Expected**: Report should download successfully

## Technical Details

### Report Storage
- Reports are stored in `media/reports/` directory
- PDF reports are generated using wkhtmltopdf
- HTML reports are generated as fallback
- Reports include screenshots and detailed analysis

### Cache Implementation
- Cache key: `url_scan_{md5_hash_of_url}`
- Cache timeout: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- Cached results now include fresh reports
